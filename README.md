## Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine the average grades and percentage of students passing math and reading for 15 high schools, grades 9-12. This project used a combination of python, pandas, jupyter notebook, and numpy in order to calculate the average grades and percentage of students passing math, reading, and both. Additionally, this project determined math and reading scores and percentages based on grade level, school budget, size, and school type.

Afterwards, new information was obtained that the Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores were dishonest, and these values were replaced with NaN values using numpy. The code was then further refactored and formatted to reflect these changes, and provide the aforementioned statistics based on the new data.

## Results
### District Summary:
The district summary saw very little change after replacing the Thomas High School math and reading scores were replaced with NaNs. The original student count was 39,170, and after refactoring the code it was 38,709, which was roughly a one percent difference from the original count.

### Per School Summary
Similar to the district summary, the amount of 9th graders at Thomas High School relative to their total number of students, made little difference in the overall scores and passing percentages. Initially, after removing the 9th grade scores altogether, the score averages and percentage had much lower values due to the number of null grades. After further refactoring of the code, the average scores and percentages for Thomas High School were updated and replaced to reflect the scores of grades 10-12.
